Carp-Always version 0.13_03
===========================

Carp::Always can be used to make a script complain loudly
with stack traces when warn()ing or die()ing.

  perl -MCarp::Always script.pl


Perl has Carp which is a module as old as Perl 5. It has
an option to print errors (from the perspective of caller) 
with stack backtrace. With a few lines of codes, this module
illustrates how to make warn() and die() noisy as well.

This module was written as a reaction to Acme::JavaTrace by
Sébastien Aperghis-Tramoni. I didn't know Sébastien or
or understood its humor at the time. That and more was 
pointed by Robert Rothenberg at CPAN ratings. But the module
idea stood and lives to help you out with debugging your code.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:
